GAME OF LIFE:

This the classic Game Of Life, including a randomizer that can make you stare and the screen for quite a while.

As it happens with, for example, the #logisticmap (https://lnkd.in/d-Vatgv) or the #Mandelbrotset (https://lnkd.in/dawcqDq), this is an extremely interesting example of how complex a system can become after a few iterations just by following a very simple set of rules, to the point that it can become an object of study by itself. For the Game Of Life there's an inmense (still growing as more discoveries are made) "life lexicon" (https://lnkd.in/dnvd5nP), truly fascinating :)
